# MS1 - FORPEX webpage

New webpage for existing Czech firm FORPEX.
 
## UX

FORPEX is a Czech family firm established in 1993. FORPEX specialises in printing. FORPEX was in the past rather succesfull, but nowadays with lower demends for printed materials the family focuses on other businesses has established other rather succesfull firm and FORPEX kind got left behind. The business is running, but needs some face-lifting including new web-page.

USER STORIES: 

The owners family expects from new web-page:
- mainly display, that the firm exists, business still runs
- beacuse the firm works with prints and design, the web-page must present certain level of design qualities.
- based on their experience, they need to talk to the (potenital) clients or exchange emails, they do not want any web-form, questionaire etc., they want client to call them or write a direct email.
- their clients are usually banks and state officess so the web-page shoud be visualy down-to-earth, representing more stability and realiability than creativity and pioneering.
- it is clear, that at the moment the other businesses of the owners family have priority, so the webpage can not demand any maitnance or activity from the family members.

The user (potentional client) should from this new webpage:
- get a basic info about FORPEX
- get a feeling, that the firm has an eye for design and looks stabile and reliable
- get simple and direct way, how to get in touch with the firm - phone, email

Here are my wireframes I created at the very beginning of the process https://github.com/zemanjirka/MS1-Forpex-webpage/blob/master/assets/images/Wireframes%20-%20FORPEX%20-%20Jiri%20Zeman%20MS1.pdf


## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
